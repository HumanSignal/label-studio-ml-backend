# Quickstart

1. Build and start Machine Learning backend on `http://localhost:9090`

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. Validate that backend is running

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090/health
{"status":"UP"}
```

3. Connect to the backend from Label Studio: go to your project `Settings -> Machine Learning -> Add Model` and specify `http://localhost:9090` as a URL.
