**Transfer learning for NLP models by annotating your textual data without any additional coding.**

This package provides a ready-to-use container that links together:

- [Label Studio](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio) as annotation frontend
- [Hugging Face's transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) as machine learning backend for NLP

##### Install Label Studio and other dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Create ML backend with BERT named entity recognizer
```bash
label-studio-ml init my-ml-backend --script ner/ner.py
cp ner/utils.py my-ml-backend/utils.py
```

##### Start ML backend at http://localhost:9090
```bash
label-studio-ml start my-ml-backend
```

##### Start Label Studio with ML backend connection
```bash
label-studio start my-annotation-project --init --ml-backend http://localhost:9090
```

The browser opens at `http://localhost:8080`. Upload your data on **Import** page then annotate by selecting **Labeling** page.
Once you've annotate sufficient amount of data, go to **Model** page and press **Start Training** button. Once training is finished, model automatically starts serving for inference from Label Studio, and you'll find all model checkpoints inside `my-ml-backend/<ml-backend-id>/` directory.
